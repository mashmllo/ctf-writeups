## Description 
We've received a report that a roomba has been detected travelling through Texas, USA. All we know is that they're likely between Houston, San Antonio or Austin. Which one, we don't know.

All we have is a video taken from inside the moving vehicle. You need to piece together the sourroundings to give us the exact road name they were travelling on.

Here is the recorded video: https://mega.nz/folder/E1lXzZYa#lZawGxAgr57-IKJPR8znhQ

For example, 16 Maple street would be: {16 Maple}

## Solution 

One of the videos has her singing in the car and a rollercoaster in the background, by going through all the rollercoasters in TX, the rollercoaster shown is San Antonio Sea World rollercoaster.

Using [google map](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.4557201,-98.6885318,3a,57.5y,236.21h,89.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seoQf_Fu56zlyX8994uEu0g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) and the video as geographical reference, the location resembles Access 151 Rd, San Antonio Texas.
