## Description 

Welcome to the CYBAR Open-Source Intelligence CTF. Most challenges can be solved with a browser and some know-how - online tools might help too. 

When you find something, whether it be a picture, text, code or whatnot, you can submit it into the CTF server by putting the 'flag format' around it. For example, if the flag asked you to find the name of a yellow fruit, and yo confirmed it was a banana, you'd submit "CYBAR{banana}". Don't worry too much about caps, it's not case-sensitive.

To kick it off, let's try your first flag. You get into work, boot up your system and hit Spotify up. You can't remember the name of the artist or song you were listening to the other day but it put you in the ZONE. Scratching your head, you remember just a line of lyrics...

"In the name of the Spam God, that's what's up"

Huh. Let's do a quick search and see if we can find the artist, and submit as a flag. When done, you can kick off their playlist to pair with the CTF.

## Solution 

Copy the lyrics into google to get the name of the artist. 

The use of apostraphes helps to improve the search result.
