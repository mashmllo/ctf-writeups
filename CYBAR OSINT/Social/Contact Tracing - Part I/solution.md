## Description 

It's suspected the Roomba targeted one of Marc's friends, Alycee, with COVID19 based on her regular flights around the world to different critical infrastructure areas (e.g. gas and oil). We must undertake contact tracing for Alycee without warning the subject. We need to find out every location she has been in the past few years to get a profile. This profile will then help us predict and prevent where she might go next.

What is the full URL of Alycee's art account?
