# WFH (EoM) - Part 2

## Details

Category: SOCIAL

Type: Automatic

Points: 100

Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Status: Playable after CTF ends

Real Person or Ficticious: Fictitious

## Description 

We need more information on the building to work out the level it's being potentially filmed from. How many levels (above ground) does the building have?

Flag format: CYBAR{x}

## Solution 

By searching for "melbourne city/building databases" a [website database containing this information](data.melbourne.vic.gov.au) is found. Other architectural and real estate sites also reveal this.

By cross referencing with multiple sources, the flag can be found. Two flags included for counting basements and not.


## Flag 
CYBAR{44} or CYBAR{36}
