What is the exact volcano that Alycee visited?

## Solution 

Looking at the images she drew, there is an image titled "The day it all changed". When the image is viewed, a volcano is shown and the word "Hawaii" is mentioned.

By comparing the volcanoes in Hawaii, the drawing looks similiar to mount Kilauea.  


## Flag 
CYBAR{Kilauea} or CYBAR{KÄ«lauea}
