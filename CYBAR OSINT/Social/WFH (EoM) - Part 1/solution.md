By observing landmarks, a building with a face (Barak Building) can be located.

Further analysis and geographical reference results in a few skyscrapers. These can be reduced by figuring out which are residential, and the angle and height taken from. 

Other buildings such as the Melbourne Gaol and RMIT buildings can also be seen in the foreground, providing depth perception.
